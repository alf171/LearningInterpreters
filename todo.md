# a couple todos which might be interesting at the EOP
    1. 23/ is there something more efficent than linear scan through local variables
    2. 23/ add support for final keyword
    3. ?/ flexible array members -- can make ObString store char[] instead of char*
    4. 21/ support variable reassignment results in duplicate constants. fix this
    5. 23/ support switch statements -- very similar to if or for
    6. 23/ support continue -- jump to the top of the nearest enclosing loop skipping rest of body
